# Ruby Dashboard

A complaint tracker and expense tracker bundled in one!

 Find similar complaints based on vector embeddings. Get suggested solutions to complaints based on similarly resolved complaints, allowing users to think less and sift through hundreds of unresolved complaints.

 Keep track of expenses, visualizing all your transactions and breaking them down for more insights. With your transactions, your future balances over time can also be predicted.
